> [!TIP]
> You can use ready-to-use prefab from Samples (skip this section if so).
1. Generate (see above) or import your color palette texture
2. Create UI image and assign the texture
3. Create child image (raycast target should be disabled, rect middle-center, size is no matter)
4. Assign outline texture to child image
5. Attach ColorPicker component to any object and assign palette image and outline rect in Inspector.

## Samples
The package includes:

📁 Samples/ contains ColorPickerDemo.unity, palette and outline images, preset example and ready-to-use prefab

Import it from Package Manager > Samples

## How to use
The ColorPicker.cs (MonoBehaviour) allows to select colors from the palette at runtime.
Subscribe to ColorSelectionChanged
```csharp
colorPicker.ColorSelectionChanged += color => {
    Debug.Log("Selected color: " + color);
};
```
Or get current selected color directly:
```csharp
var currentSelectedColor = colorPicker.CurrentSelectedColor;
```
> [!NOTE]
> Default color before the very first selection is white-transparent
